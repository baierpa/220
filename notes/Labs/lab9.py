    this function keeps track of whose turn it is.

    - then we print the board and get the user input for where they want to go
    - the next condition is only necessary if the game is keeping track of which player is going. if you don't do that,
    then you should only need the fill_spot() function. in this case though, we need to know which player is up so we can
    automatically fill in the correct symbol. we also need to change players so the game knows the next player is up.
    You will notice that before we change players, we check if the move was legal. We do this because, if the move is not
    legal, we want the same player to go again. we can still call fill_spot, because the move will be illegal and nothing
    will change.
    - once the game is over, we reprint the board and say game over.
    we could try to say which player one, but then we would have to differentiate between winning vs. no more moves, which
    we currently do not do. So rather than that, we just stick with a generic game over message.
